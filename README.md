<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="https://github.com/libkosmos/kosbook/kosbook.png">

kosbook is a brute force application built on python3 which enables the tester to enter the victims account by using their API, it uses various libraries like optparse, re and more.

How does it work?
* kosbook is social engineering application, User can only hack the victims account if they are good in guessing and assuming other people trades and values.
* It uses wordlist to perform a sucessful hack, all the way the user have to update the wordlist.txt file which is already provided to make a hack attempt.


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
